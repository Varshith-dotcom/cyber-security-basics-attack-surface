CIA Triad

The CIA Triad represents the three core principles of information security:

1. Confidentiality

Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized entities.
Controls: Encryption, access control, authentication, data masking.

2. Integrity

Ensures data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered except by authorized actions.
Controls: Hashing, digital signatures, checksums, version control.

3. Availability

Ensures systems and data are accessible when required.
Controls: Redundancy, backups, failover mechanisms, DoS protection.
Attack Surfaces

The attack surface is the total set of entry points where an attacker can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.

1. Digital Attack Surface

Web applications

Network ports & services

APIs & cloud interfaces

Software vulnerabilities

2. Physical Attack Surface

Physical access to devices

USB ports

Network hardware

3. Human / Social Attack Surface

Employees and users

Phishing emails

Weak security awareness
