Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

## Cyber Security
Cyber Security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber attacks such as hacking, malware, phishing, and data breaches.

## Objectives of Cyber Security
- Confidentiality – Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access
- Integrity – Ensuring data is not altered or tampered with
- Availability – Making systems and data accessible when required

## Types of Cyber Threats
- Malware (Virus, Worm, Trojan)
- Phishing Attacks
- Ransomware
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

## What is an Attack Surface?
The attack surface refers to all possible points where an attacker can attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system.

## Types of Attack Surface
### 1. Digital Attack Surface
- Web applications
- Network ports
- APIs
- Software vulnerabilities

### 2. Physical Attack Surface
- USB ports
- Physical access to systems
- Hardware devices

### 3. Social Engineering Attack Surface
- Phishing emails
- Fake phone calls
- Human errors

## Importance of Reducing Attack Surface
- Minimizes security risks
- Limits entry points for attackers
- Improves overall system security

## Methods to Reduce Attack Surface
- Regular software updates and patching
- Strong authentication mechanisms
- Network segmentation
- Employee security awareness training
